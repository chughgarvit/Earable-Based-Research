## Introduction

Earable devices are emerging as versatile tools in the realm of wearable technology. They have the potential to revolutionize how we monitor physiological signals, detect activities, and even assess mental health—all through sensors that can be worn comfortably around the ear. This repository curates research assets that include datasets and toolkits aimed at advancing our understanding and utilization of earable technologies.

Whether you're interested in measuring facial muscle activity, tracking sleep events, detecting exercise mistakes, or monitoring respiratory parameters, the resources here are designed to support a wide range of research endeavors.
